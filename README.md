## Getting Started Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun as the package manager (inferred from `bun.lockb`). If you don't have Bun installed, follow the instructions [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
    *Alternatively, if you prefer npm or yarn:* 
    ```sh
    # Using npm
    # npm install 

    # Using yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
    *Note: Using a different package manager might result in slightly different dependency versions than specified in `bun.lockb`.*

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
    *Or using npm/yarn:*
    ```sh
    # npm run dev
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.
